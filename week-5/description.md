Week 5 - Team Andromedus social event:

We got together and carpooled over to Urban Spoon at Diamond Jamboree on Wednesday at ~5:30pm for a group dinner during their happy hour. We all order some great Korean food on Kathleen's recommendation and enjoyed good conversations over a tasty meal. After a little over an hour we parted ways and headed back.
