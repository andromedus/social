# Week 2 team social event

Team Andromedus

Alexis Hoshino, Eric Tian, HQ Pham-Nguyen, Kathleen Enverga

Our team met up at the University Town Center at 10:00am on Friday, April 11th for a light brunch and some bonding time. We got to know each other a little better from just hanging out, eating, and talking together for nearly two hours until we had to go to work/class.
