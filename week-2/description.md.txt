# Week 2 team social event

Team Andromedus

Alexis Hoshino, Eric Tian, HQ Pham-Nguyen, Kathleen Enverga

Our team met up at University Tower Center at 10:00am on Friday 4/11 for a light brunch and some bonding time. We got to know each a little better from just hanging out, eating and talking together for nearly 2 hours until we had to go to work/class.
